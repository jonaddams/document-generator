# Document Generator Session Notes

## Project Status

This is a Next.js 14+ TypeScript application demonstrating Nutrient's Document Authoring and Web SDKs. The project has been upgraded to Tailwind v4 and now includes both the original migrated app and a new modern wizard implementation.

## Recent Work Completed

### 1. Tailwind v4 Upgrade

- ✅ Updated `tailwind.config.ts` to ES modules format
- ✅ Updated `postcss.config.js` to use '@tailwindcss/postcss'
- ✅ Changed `src/styles/globals.css` to use single `@import "tailwindcss"`
- ✅ Added CSS custom properties for Nutrient brand colors

### 2. Bug Fixes in Original App

- ✅ Fixed DOM timing issues with Document Authoring SDK
- ✅ Resolved CodeMirror cleanup conflicts
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop in DocxEditor useEffect dependencies
- ✅ Added global error handler for IntersectionObserver SDK errors
- ✅ Implemented robust DOM validation and container cleanup

### 3. New Modern Wizard Implementation

- ✅ Created new wizard at `/wizard` route with clean React patterns
- ✅ Implemented React Context + useReducer for state management
- ✅ Built 5-step wizard: Template Selection → Customize → Data → Preview → Download
- ✅ Fixed overlapping step indicator layout issue
- ✅ Fixed template category badge alignment inconsistency

## Current Application Architecture

### Routes

- `/` - Home page with links to both original app and new wizard
- `/wizard` - New modern wizard implementation (primary focus)
- Original app components remain as reference in `src/components/`

### New Wizard Structure (`src/app/wizard/`)

```
wizard/
├── page.tsx                    # Main wizard page
├── context/
│   └── WizardContext.tsx       # React Context with useReducer
├── components/
│   ├── WizardLayout.tsx        # Main layout with loading/error states
│   ├── StepIndicator.tsx       # Step progress indicator (FIXED)
│   ├── StepContent.tsx         # Step content router
│   ├── StepNavigation.tsx      # Navigation buttons
│   └── steps/
│       ├── TemplateStep.tsx    # Template selection (FIXED alignment)
│       ├── CustomizeStep.tsx   # Template customization
│       ├── DataStep.tsx        # JSON data editing
│       ├── PreviewStep.tsx     # Document preview
│       └── DownloadStep.tsx    # Final download/completion
```

## Issues Resolved

### StepIndicator Layout Fix

**Problem**: Step indicator had overlapping text labels due to absolute positioning
**Solution**: Replaced with clean two-tier grid layout:

- Step circles with connectors in flex container
- Step labels in separate grid below
- File: `src/app/wizard/components/StepIndicator.tsx`

### Template Category Badge Alignment

**Problem**: Category badges ("Business", "Productivity", "Food & Beverage") had inconsistent alignment
**Solution**: Added `flex-1`, `whitespace-nowrap`, and `ml-2` classes for consistent right alignment

- File: `src/app/wizard/components/steps/TemplateStep.tsx`

## Next Steps Needed

### 1. SDK Integration (High Priority)

The new wizard currently has placeholder functionality. Need to integrate:

- Document Authoring SDK for template editing (CustomizeStep)
- CodeMirror for JSON data editing (DataStep)
- Document Authoring SDK for document editing (PreviewStep)
- Web SDK for PDF generation (DownloadStep)

### 2. Template Processing

- Port DocJSON template loading from original app
- Implement handlebars-style variable replacement
- Connect template selection to actual file loading

### 3. Data Management

- Implement JSON data validation
- Add data model persistence
- Connect data to document population

### 4. File Operations

- Template upload functionality
- Document export (PDF/DOCX)
- Error handling for file operations

## Development Environment

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run lint        # Lint code
npm run type-check  # TypeScript validation
```

### Current Status

- Development server runs on port 3001 (port 3000 in use)
- All TypeScript compilation passes
- Tailwind v4 working correctly
- New wizard UI fully functional for navigation

## Technical Debt Notes

### Original App Issues (Low Priority)

The original migrated app (`src/components/`) has accumulated technical debt:

- Complex DOM timing issues with SDK integration
- Memory management challenges
- Less maintainable component structure
- Keep as reference but focus development on new wizard

### Code Quality

- New wizard follows modern React patterns
- Uses TypeScript strictly throughout
- Implements proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Follows Tailwind v4 best practices

## Files Modified in This Session

### Configuration

- `tailwind.config.ts` - Converted to ES modules, v4 format
- `postcss.config.js` - Updated for v4 compatibility
- `src/styles/globals.css` - New import syntax

### New Wizard Implementation

- `src/app/wizard/page.tsx` - Main wizard page
- `src/app/wizard/context/WizardContext.tsx` - State management
- `src/app/wizard/components/WizardLayout.tsx` - Layout component
- `src/app/wizard/components/StepIndicator.tsx` - **FIXED** step progress
- `src/app/wizard/components/StepContent.tsx` - Content router
- `src/app/wizard/components/StepNavigation.tsx` - Navigation
- `src/app/wizard/components/steps/TemplateStep.tsx` - **FIXED** alignment
- `src/app/wizard/components/steps/CustomizeStep.tsx` - Placeholder
- `src/app/wizard/components/steps/DataStep.tsx` - Placeholder
- `src/app/wizard/components/steps/PreviewStep.tsx` - Placeholder
- `src/app/wizard/components/steps/DownloadStep.tsx` - Completion screen

### Updated Pages

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added wizard link

## Repository State

- All changes committed and ready for GitHub
- Clean working directory
- TypeScript compilation passing
- No lint errors
- Development server functional

## Resumption Instructions

When resuming this session:

1. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Focus on SDK integration in wizard steps (highest priority)
4. Reference original app components for SDK usage patterns
5. Test each step as SDK integration is added

The new wizard provides a clean foundation for implementing the full document generation workflow with modern React patterns and better maintainability.
